  <h2>Chapter One</h2>
  <p>  You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch. Cloth talk. They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. I’m up to something. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. You smart, you loyal, you a genius.</p>
  <h2>Chapter Two</h2>
  <p>In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key. Congratulations, you played yourself. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. I told you all this before, when you have a swimming pool, do not use chlorine, use salt water, the healing, salt water is the healing.</p>
  <h2>Chapter Three</h2>
  <p>Every chance I get, I water the plants, Lion! They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. You should never complain, complaining is a weak emotion, you got life, we breathing, we blessed. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail. Look at the sunset, life is amazing, life is beautiful, life is what you make it. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. In life you have to take the trash out, if you have trash in your life, take it out, throw it away, get rid of it, major key.</p>
